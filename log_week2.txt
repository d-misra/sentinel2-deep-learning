Week 2 Log

- Created branch on master, deleted cloned repo. Now able to pull and push from branch. 
- Going through notebook example still and making sense of libraries.
- Weekly call coming up on Wed: questions? 
	- Technical stuff 
	- Make a new plan 
	
- Researching raster data format 
- Getting to grips with Git and the repository 
- Still working through the example and notebook 
- Going through each of the library scripts and making sure I understand 

Questions

Give general outline of what is going on up to where ive got, explaining along the way how you stopped to explore the library. 

- Just to confirm, no downsampling is taking place? 

POINT EXTRACTOR 

- In the example vs notebook, example uses PointExtractor class to deal with issue of conflicting projections - grabs pixels 
and makes a df of there position and value. So this dataframe would be the same for the same points from images of different 
projections. It removes any idea of perspective and distortion? 

- Within PE, you also designate the CRS to be the same as that of the AOI 

- Subverts the requirement for having identical projections? 

- Creates df where all values are 0? 

- Is point extractor the way to go, notebook example doesn't use this - is this to just show conflict of projections? 

CREATE SAMPLE RASTER 

- CRS still has to be set as that of the corine file 

- So it's within this function the projections/reference systems are matched and labelling takes place. 
- Also columns are added to df of extracted points and the corine pixels are read. A value is created based on the location of each extracted point
and its corresponding corine pixel value. 

- Got error when using 4 bands like in the example: Shape conflict, is this because the mask is made up of the 8-band image, so need to keep it 8?

OUTLIER REMOVAL 

- When I remove outliers, get an error similar to that in the notebook, "A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a dataframe" 
STILL RUNS, but does this mean the projection is incorrect? Fixed vis use of S2 Proj, just curious as to what is happening here? 

ZERO SAMPLE FUNCTION 

- Zero samples function gives error about operands not being broadcast together, reads shapes (1000, 9) (5,). I didn't use it here but just curious
as to what is happening?

CLASSIFY FUNCTION 

- Tried with small amount of points, just trying to make sense of evaluation criteria. 

Getting error when creating geodataframe based on the data from the mask - why is this done? 
- data values are all -9999s
- Fully get how we are making ghte train test split with the df of Bands, labels and extra indices
- Just after that, within the ml.py, am confused about this mask_src - why are there no values? 
- Gives a gdf of all bands with -9999 

The inner working of this function seem to create a list of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 from bands, but then .read() makes an array of 9999s per band? 

- It's this gdf data which seems to be used in Alexey's window resolution example 


STARTING TO LOOK AT WINDOW RESOLUTION 

Data on GitLab?

***** Post call ******

- Increased number of points
- Looking at evaluation metrics 

- Tell alexey cant download teams on linux, no screen share
- Tidying script 
- Looking at classify function further to work out performance metrics 
- Working out remove outliers function 


***** Next week

- Getting key error in indices function, put in temp_bands to change gdf columns 

- Have a variable patch size based on average pixel value in patch... If lot of information
in buffer then patch will be smaller... vice versa for low info area. 

- Lots of patches in cities.. good or bad? 

- Texture analysis - textures will range from regular, irregular to stochastic
