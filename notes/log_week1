Week 1 

- Research into raster data and image processing stuff 

Image process:

Raster data:

- Rasterio installation and intro tutorial 
- Beginning review of land-cover maps starting with learning about CORINE
- Intro to GIS with Python:

https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/CSC18/lessons/L1/Geometric-Objects.html

- Shapely module - used for manipulating and analysis of planar geometric objects, vector format. 

- Received access to GitLab repo, forked to own and set up virtual env on pycharm. Recreating example notebook.
- Received sample data - one Sentinel scene land classification map which has been processed with Level-2A
processing algorithm:

- Arranging weekly call 

Wednesday 15th

- Asked Alexey about data format. S2A directory is the format in which ESA stores the Sentinel data.
Includes image data (JPEG2000), quality indicators, auxillary data and metadata. 

- Changed mask function (removed mask path arg, changed in func to merge path)

- Got merge_bands working, learning how the merge into a 3D block of rasters works. Working on writing 
raster function. Also found cool github which shows the spectral plot of single pixel:

- Alexey has redone example script and suggests using single repo. Figuring out how to do this. Need to
reset git repo access.
