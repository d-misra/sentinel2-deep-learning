- Getting key error in indices function, put in temp_bands to change gdf columns 

Variable Patch Idea

- Have a variable patch size based on average pixel value in patch... If lot of information
in buffer then patch will be smaller... vice versa for low info area. 

- Would need to know information of pixels within patch

- Would all patches have to be rectangles? Could get complicated having irregular sizes. 

- Min/max values dictate size? Outliers removed though 

- Lots of patches in cities.. good or bad? 

- Overlap of patches? 

- Texture analysis - textures will range from regular, irregular to stochastic 

Set Patch Size 

- Experiment with different, consistently sized buffers
