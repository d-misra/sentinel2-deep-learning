- Put better variable in remove_outliers func to access only df bands 
- Getting key error in indices function, put in temp_bands to change gdf columns 

Variable Patch Idea

- Have a variable patch size based on average pixel value in patch... If lot of information
in buffer then patch will be smaller... vice versa for low info area. 

- Would need to know information of pixels within patch

- Would all patches have to be rectangles? Could get complicated having irregular sizes. 

- Min/max values dictate size? Outliers removed though 

- Lots of patches in cities.. good or bad? 

- Overlap of patches? 

- Texture analysis - textures will range from regular, irregular to stochastic 

Set Patch Size 

- Experiment with different, consistently sized buffers 

- Need to put in filter in indice calculations for when we introduce patches 

- Fit distribution to patch based on std of mean 

- x - mean /std  

- Test dataset need to have same patches 

- Arbritrary window sizes 

- Try range of buffer sizes. 

- Corine pixel size varying - pick dominant label. 

- Validation set made up of QGIS - Corine unreliable. 


Meeting with Marc, literature review. 

- GlobCover Land Maps 
- Wavelength selection, as mentioned:

https://www.geospatialworld.net/article/land-cover-classification-from-remote-sensing-data/

AVIRIS has 224 wavelengths, for example: 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5567331_Lossless_compression_of_AVIRIS_images

Need to consider which S2 to use/add to

h20 package https://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/master/3190/docs-website/h2o-docs/booklets/DeepLearning_Vignette.pdf
