- fully set on FCN and a combination of segmentation/atrous convolution/upsampling/CRFs
- attempting graph based segmentation
	- group into clusters then use selective search to merge into larger groups 
- attempting DeepLab implementation with rastervision

Need to figure out training set before getting implementation going

	-> trying to figure out training data issue: sampling vs tiling
	-> emailed paper (remote sensing lidar seg)

Buffer of 2 means 5x5 patch. Means 25*8 pixel values per entry, plus 25 labels and 4 indices (savi,  ndwi,  evi, ndvi)
-> 229 columns for a 5x5 patch. 
-> Common solution is to make whole patch label that of central pixel, however does this not make patch creation
redundant, as could just take the label of the extracted pixel. 
-> Leaning more to training on whole tile. Same issue though -> if a tile is an input, what is its label. 

Post call

- Use most common pixel for labelling of patch.
- Beware object detection context, not relevant.

Good Keras Sentinel-2 tutorial, however data is 10,000 images with one class per image
 - 10,000 patches with most common label assigned for each. 
 
Got barebones Keras NN working ~65% accuracy for 100k points. Run time improved when dissecting classify function.

Trying to integrate DEM data - getting memory error when merging rasters
