QGIS issues v frustrating 

- Sorted out DEM crs 
- Need to think about resolution difference: 1 pixel of DEM ~ 2x3 s2

4 types of segmentation: Felzenswalb (graph), Quickshift, SLIC and Compact watershed

https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_segmentations.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-segmentation-plot-segmentations-py

- Got segmentation working with true colour image, Felzenszwalb looking good
	- Doesn't split up fields.
	- Felz and Quick only ones that pick up roads well. 

- Segment ID pixel idea

- Trying to change DEM res in QGIS

- validation set issue for s2 data

- in general, semantic segmentation yields better (homogeneous) results than patch-wise classification

- one patch only has one label, so many different classes are present in patch

The problem with semantic segmentation is the lack of public available training data. 

- could try to rasterize and generalize the OSM

data sets for aerial images, starting point for transfer learning

DEM stuff - dem vastly different extent meaning appearing on diff zone of display, even if on same CRS 

lit review begins 

- predicting on patches but going through each class making a decision on each 

-> patch method in order to train on new image which is broken up into patches 
	- would mean could use pretrained model which has been trained up on dataset of single-label images.
	- idea is that each patch to be predicted on in the new image would resemble the single-labelled training images. 

- back to segmentation getting rasterstats working
- tidied scripts 

- WKT vs geojson - WKT can support various CRSs whereas GeoJson coordinates are all in WGS 84. 
				 - WKT can support curved shapes, GeoJson cannot
				 
- WKT seems superior type for data parsing
