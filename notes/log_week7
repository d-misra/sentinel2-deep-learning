QGIS issues v frustrating 

- Sorted out DEM crs 
- Need to think about resolution difference: 1 pixel of DEM ~ 2x3 s2

4 types of segmentation: Felzenswalb (graph), Quickshift, SLIC and Compact watershed

- Got segmentation working with true colour image, Felzenszwalb looking good
	- Doesn't split up fields.
	- Felz and Quick only ones that pick up roads well. 
	
- Segment ID pixel idea
