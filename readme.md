# Primer code and data for textural analysis with Sentinel-2 data

## Introduction
This is some primer code for GSI's proposed land classification process. 

An example is available in `example.py`. The same with some more information is available in `notebooks/LC_Primer.py`.

The code is not free of bugs so please let me know if there is something you cannot fix by creating an issue in GitLab.
