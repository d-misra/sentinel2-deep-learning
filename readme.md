# Primer code and data for textural analysis with Sentinel-2 data

## Introduction
This is some primer code for GSI's proposed land classification process. 

## Land classification package
First you need to install the package. You need to run

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

or for just the land_classification package (if, say, you made changes to the source code),

```pip install -e land_classification```

An example is available in `example.py`. The same with some more information is available in `notebooks/LC_Primer.py`.

The code is not free of bugs so please let me know if there is something you cannot fix by creating an issue in GitLab.
